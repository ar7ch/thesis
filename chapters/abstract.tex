As IEEE 802.11-compatible ("Wi-Fi") Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) become ubiquitous, the rising density of WLAN deployments leads to congestion of frequency bands and performance degradation due to interference. Thus, Radio Resource Management (RRM) algorithms for mitigating those problems become in demand, especially for large WLAN deployments. While several commercial RRM solutions exist, their implementation details remain undisclosed. At the same time, proposals from previous research have considerable obstacles for production usage. This thesis presents a novel super-cell RRM algorithm. This algorithm adjusts frequency and transmission power parameters based on physical-layer and link-layer metrics, and employs usage of a WLAN Controller (WLC) as a central entity able to gather data for overall WLAN. Integrated into the Wimark WLC RRM module, our approach achieves up to 67\% faster convergence without requiring changes to the 802.11 standard. With enhanced spectrum management, our algorithm delivers 31\% increase in Signal-to-Interference-Plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) on Access Points (APs) and up to 29\% bandwidth improvement compared to legacy algorithms, demonstrating its readiness for production usage and integration into existing enterprise infrastructure.
