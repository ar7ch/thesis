As IEEE 802.11-compatible ("Wi-Fi") Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) become ubiquitous, the rising density of WLAN deployments leads to congestion of frequency bands and performance degradation due to interference. Thus, Radio Resource Management (RRM) algorithms for mitigating those problems become in demand, especially for large WLAN deployments. While several commercial RRM solutions exist, their implementation details remain undisclosed. At the same time, most of the previous studies only evaluate performance in simulators and have considerable obstacles for production usage. In this study, I present a novel centralized RRM algorithm for multi-AP WLAN deployments. This algorithm adjusts frequency and transmission power parameters of access points based on physical-layer metrics, and uses WLAN Controller (WLC) as a central entity to gather data and perform computations. Integrated into the Wimark WLC RRM module, my approach achieves up to 67\% faster convergence on 2.4 GHz IEEE 802.11n-compatible WLAN. With enhanced spectrum management, my algorithm delivers 31\% increase in Signal-to-Interference-Plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) on Access Points (APs) and up to 29\% bandwidth improvement compared to legacy Wimark Systems algorithm, demonstrating that the algorithm is production-ready and can be easily integrated into existing enterprise WLAN infrastructures.
