\label{appx:table:defs_table} \\
    \hline
    \textbf{Term} & \textbf{Definition} \\ \hline
    Signal & Airborne RF energy \cite{colemanCWNACertifiedWireless2021} \\
    \hline
    Channel & A band of frequencies that 802.11 devices can use for communications \cite{AuthoritativeDictionaryIEEE2000} \\
    \hline
    Inteference & Destructive influence of another signal leading to degradation of signal quality and loss of frames \\
    \hline
    Noise & RF signal that cannot be demodulated as 802.11 signal \\
    \hline
    SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) & Signal quality metric, defined as ratio of signal power to the noise \\
    \hline
    SINR (Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio) & Signal quality metric, defined as ratio of signal power to the sum of noise power and power of interefering signals \\
    \hline
    RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) & A metric of a wireless signal quality defined in 802.11, varying from 0 to 255, where exact mappings to Rx signal power are vendor-specific. \\
    \hline
    Radio cell & Geographical area covered by a radio transmitter \cite{tanenbaumComputerNetworks2020} \\
    \hline
    Basic Service Set (BSS) & Set of stations belonging to the same radio cell and exchanging information \cite{konsgenSpectrumManagementAlgorithms2010} \\
    \hline
    Distribution System (DS) & Network that interconnects multiple BSSs and provides connectivity to a wired network \cite{konsgenSpectrumManagementAlgorithms2010} \\
    \hline
    Extended Service Set (ESS) & Set of Basic Service Sets connected by a DS \cite{konsgenSpectrumManagementAlgorithms2010} \\
    \hline
    Station (STA) & Client device that can connect to a wireless LAN \\
    \hline
    Access Point (AP) & Device providing stations wireless access to a distribution system \\
    \hline
    Infrastructure mode & Centralized mode of 802.11 WLAN operation using a star topology, where AP serves as a central entity for managing WLAN and switching traffic \\
    \hline
    Network capacity & Maximum transmission rate that any station can achieve in a given WLAN \\
    \hline
    Tx & Short notation for "Transmission" or "Transmit" \\
    \hline
    Rx & Short notation for "Receipt" or "Receive" \\
    \hline
