  abstract = {With CleanAir technology, the Cisco Unified Wireless Network correlates sources of interference across the network, supporting intelligent decisions and policies for faster troubleshooting and automatic RF interference avoidance. CleanAir technology makes it easy for network administrators to assess service disruptions, receive notices about performance degradation, and research resolutions and quickly take action to improve network performance. The CleanAir solution is part of the industry’s most adaptive, reliable, and high-performance wireless network - a network that has the ability to adjust automatically to changes in its environment, without the need for time-intensive or costly human intervention. Add to that Cisco’s ability through Cisco’s Second Generation Aironet Access Points that allows for different levels of Spectrum Intelligence from CleanAir Express on the 1700 and 1600 Access Point for small to medium sized networks to CleanAIr with WSM on the 3700 and 3600 Access Point for large scale networks.},
