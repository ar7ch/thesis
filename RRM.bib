As 802.11ac access points (APs) are rapidly adopted in enterprise environments, new challenges arise. This paper first presents an overview of trends in enterprise wireless networks based on a large-scale measurement study, in which we collect data from an anonymous subset of millions of radio access points in hundreds of thousands of real-world deployments. Based on the observed data and our experience deploying wireless networks at scale, we then propose two techniques that we have implemented in Meraki APs to improve both overall network capacity and performance perceived by end users: (i) a dynamic channel assignment algorithm, TurboCA, that adjusts to frequent RF condition changes, and (ii) a novel approach, FastACK, that improves the end-to-end performance of TCP traversing high-throughput wireless links. Finally, we evaluate TurboCA with metrics taken from a variety of real-world networks and evaluate TCP performance of FastACK with extensive testbed experiments.},

  abstract = {Current interference management solutions for dense IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) rely on locally measuring the cumulative interference at the Acess Point (AP) in charge of adjusting the spectrum resources to its clients. These solutions often result in coarse-grained spectrum allocation that often leaves many wireless users unsatisfied and increases the spectrum congestion problem instead of easing it. In this paper, we present a centralized interference management algorithm that treats the network-wide interference impact of each channel individually and allows the controller to adjust the radio resource of each AP while it is utilised. This coordinated allocation takes into account the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of downlink flows while minimizing its effect on neighbouring APs. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel approach for quantifying the interference impact of each employed channel and jointly addressing the user-side quality requirements and the network-side interference management. The algorithm is tailored for operator-agnostic Software-Defined Networking (SDN)-based Radio Resource Management (RRM) in dense Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) networks and adopts a fine-grained per-flow approach. Simulation results show that our algorithm outperforms existing solutions in terms of reducing the overall interference, increasing the capacity of the wireless channel, and improving the users’ satisfaction.},

The IEEE 802.11ax standard, also known as Wi-Fi 6, promises to provide data rates of up to almost 10 Gb/s, lower energy consumption, and higher reliability. Its capabilities go far beyond Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) and novel technical concepts have been introduced for this purpose. As such, the Wi-Fi 6 standard includes Multi-User Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (MU OFDMA), Multi-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU MIMO), new mechanisms for Spatial Reuse (SR), new mechanisms for power saving, higher-order modulation, and additional minor improvements. In this paper, we provide a survey of Wi-Fi 6. Initially, we provide a compact technological summary of Wi-Fi 5 and its predecessors. Then, we discuss the potential application domains of Wi-Fi 6, which are enabled through its novel features. Subsequently, we explain these features and review the related works in these areas. Finally, performance evaluation tools for Wi-Fi 6 and future roadmaps are discussed.},

Interestingly enough, de facto standards in terms of uncoordinated channel selection are quite simple, and in many cases result in fairly suboptimal channel allocations. Here, we explore how graph coloring can be used to evaluate and inform decisions on Wi-Fi channel selection in uncoordinated settings. Graph coloring, in its most basic form, is a classic mathematical problem where colors have to be assigned to nodes in a graph while avoiding assigning the same color to adjacent nodes. In this paper, we modeled Wi-Fi uncoordinated channel selection as a graph coloring problem and evaluated the performance of different uncoordinated channel selection techniques in a set of representative scenarios of residential buildings. The results confirm some of the widely accepted consensus regarding uncoordinated channel selection but also provide some new insights. For instance, in some settings, it would be better to delegate the decision on which channel to use to transmit the STAs, rather than having the AP make the decision on its own, which is the usual way.},

  abstract = {Adopting OFDMA and MU-MIMO techniques for both downlink and uplink IEEE 802.11ax will help next-generation WLANs efficiently cope with large numbers of devices but will also raise some research challenges. One of these is how to optimize the channelization, resource allocation, beamforming design, and MCS selection jointly for IEEE 802.11ax-based WLANs. In this paper, this technical requirement is formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear programming problem maximizing the total system throughput for the WLANs consisting of unicast users with multicast groups. A novel two-stage solution approach is proposed to solve this challenging problem. The first stage aims to determine the precoding vectors under unit-power constraints. These temporary precoders help re-form the main problem into a joint power and radio resource allocation one. Then, two low-complexity algorithms are proposed to cope with the new problem in stage two. The first is developed based on the well-known compressed sensing method while the second seeks to optimize each of the optimizing variables alternatively until reaching converged outcomes. The outcomes corresponding to the two stages are then integrated to achieve the complete solution. Numerical results are provided to confirm the superior performance of the proposed algorithms over benchmarks.},

In particular, 802.11 devices face a host of problems such as interference with other 802.11 devices (hidden terminals) as well as with technologies like Bluetooth and ZigBee. Understanding how the medium is utilized and inferring the cause of interference, based on observations from a single wireless node, is hard. Past work has used monitoring infrastructures to detect interference between 802.11 nodes in enterprise networks. In this paper, we try to answer the question: "how can we enable users to reason about wireless performance variations without requiring elaborate instrumentation and infrastructure support?". We propose WiMed, a tool that uses only local measurements from commodity 802.11 NICs (at the node being diagnosed) to construct a time map of how the medium is utilized. We have implemented a WiMed prototype using the MadWifi driver for Atheros NICs. Early results show that WiMed is useful and can characterize non-802.11 interference better than existing systems.},

In order to improve the performance of data transmissions in WLANs, the channel allocation must be carried out with care by considering such CCI among APs. In this letter, we propose a deep learning (DL) based channel allocation scheme to minimize the overall CCI experienced by the APs, thereby improving the network’s performance. To this end, a deep neural network (DNN) structure and an unsupervised learning-based training methodology are designed. The performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed DL-based scheme achieves near-optimal performance with low computational time complexity.},

  abstract = {The design of a wireless local area network (WLAN) has an important issue of determining the optimal placement of access points (AP) and assignment of channels to them. WLAN services in the outdoor as well as indoor environments should be designed in order to achieve the maximum coverage and throughput. To provide the maximum coverage for WLAN service areas, AP should be installed such that the sum of signal measured at each traffic demand point is maximized. However, as users connected to an AP share wireless channel bandwidth with others in the same AP, AP placement should be carefully decided to maximize the throughput by considering load balancing among AP and channel interference for the user traffic demand. In this paper, therefore, we propose an approach of optimizing AP placement and channel assignment in WLAN by formulating an optimal integer linear programming (ILP) problem. The optimization objective is to minimize the maximum of channel utilization, which qualitatively represents congestion at the hot spot in WLAN service areas. It is seen from the simulation results that the proposed method finds the optimal AP placement and channels which minimize the maximum of channel utilization.},

To mitigate the negative effects of channel contention, the Target Wake Time (TWT) mechanism included in the IEEE 802.11ax amendment can have a significant role, as it provides an extremely simple but effective mechanism to schedule transmissions in time. Moreover, in addition to reduce the contention between stations, the use of TWT may also contribute to take full advantage of other novel mechanisms in the IEEE 802.11 universe, such as multiuser transmissions, multiAP cooperation, spatial reuse and coexistence in high-density WLAN scenarios. Overall, we believe TWT may be a first step towards a practical collision-free and deterministic access in future WLANs.},

In such dense WLAN environment, the WLAN users can suffer from performance degradation due to high co-channel and adjacent-channel interference among APs. To tackling such user performance degradation problem, we propose a two-phase radio resource management (RRM) framework, of which the first phase is channel assignment (CA) and the second phase is user association for channel load balancing (UA-ChLB). In designing the RRM framework, we take account of typical WLAN environment where dual bands are supported and two types of APs coexist: controlled-APs, which are managed by a centralized controller, and stand-alone APs, which independently operate for themselves. The proposed CA method utilizes a channel bonding technique, which provides a high data rate by integrating multiple basic channels while reducing the interference among neighboring APs. The proposed hybrid UA-ChLB scheme, which is composed of distributed/centralized UA-ChLB, efficiently coordinates the channel load among neighboring APs and between two bands of 2.4 and 5 GHz, under consideration of the wireless channel quality, interference, and traffic conditions. We implement a prototype system in practice using the proposed RRM scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed RRM scheme greatly improves both throughput and fairness in dense WLAN environment, as compared with some existing schemes.},

Meanwhile, these users are increasingly interested in multimedia applications such as video streaming and Voice over IP (VoIP), which require strict Quality of Service (QoS) support. Provisioning network resources with such constraints is a challenging task. In fact, considering the availability of various access technologies (WiFi, WiMAX, or cellular networks), it is difficult for a network operator to find reliable criteria to select the best network that ensures user satisfaction while maximizing network utilization. Designing an efficient Radio Resource Management (RRM), in this type of environment, is mandatory for solving such problems.

However, it faces the following challenges: (1) it can exacerbate receiver-side interference and asymmetric channel access, (2) it can incorrectly lead to lowering the data rate of a link, (3) mobility-induced channel variations at short timescales make detecting and avoiding these problems more complex. Despite significant research in rate and power control, state of the art solutions lack comprehensive techniques to address the above problems.   In this paper, we design and implement Symphony - a Synchronous Two-phase Rate and Power control system, whose agility in adaptation enables us to systematically address the three problems, while maximizing the benefits of power control on a per-link basis. We implement Symphony in the Linux Madwifi driver, and show that it can be realized on hardware that supports transmit power control with no modifications to the 802.11 MAC, thereby fostering immediate deployability. Our extensive experimental evaluation on a real testbed in an office environment demonstrates that Symphony (1) enables up to 80\% of the clients in 3 different cells to settle at 50\% to 94\% lower transmit power than a per-cell power control solution, (2) increases network throughput by up to 50\% across realistic deployment scenarios, (3) improves the throughput of asymmetry-affected links by 300\%, and (4) opportunistically reduces the transmit power of mobile clients running VOIP calls by up to 97\%, while causing minimum impact on voice quality.},

Currently, the APs composing this housing complex are centrally configured through a channel selection approach based on a genetic algorithm that aims to minimize the cumulative interference experienced by each AP. In this work, we present the performance of an alternative channel assignment algorithm in comparison to the existing genetic one. More specifically, the algorithm investigated in this work aims to minimize a network-wide parameter called interference impact, which represents the interference caused by an AP to all the other APs in the neighbourhood. Moreover, the algorithm is implemented using the spectrum programming architecture Wi-5 based on Software-Defined Networking (SDN). Although the benefits of this algorithm have been demonstrated in simulated environments, this work presents its first evaluation in a dense real world scenario. The performance analysis illustrates the important gains obtained in terms of the data transmissions quality through the proposed algorithm compared against the AP channel selection approach currently implemented in the considered scenario.},

In this paper, we propose a generic methodology to measure RAP's carrier sense interference and hidden terminal interference, and it only uses readily available SNMP metrics, without any additional measurement hardware. Our results show that, on average, the carrier sense interference due to RAPs causes only 5\% access delay increase at the MAC layer, because of careful engineering and software optimization. However, hidden terminal interference due to RAPs causes (a much more severe) up to 30\% MAC layer loss rate increase on average, because no existing approach has explicitly dealt with the hidden terminal impact from rogue APs. Overall, the RAP interference would increase the IP layer delay at the WiFi hop by up to 50\%.},

  abstract = {802.11 (WiFi) networks have become increasingly important for our daily lives. However, previous work has shown that enterprise WiFi performance is often unsatisfactory and that over-utilization and interference from rogue APs are the two primary reasons. To address the above problem, this paper proposes to improve the capacity of WiFi infrastructures by increasing the enterprise AP deployment density, as well as disabling the wired Internet access in buildings to eliminate rogue APs and their interference. We deployed several WiFi networks with different AP density and vendors on Tsinghua campus. Based on the measurement results from our real-world deployments, we made three main observations: 1) in general, higher AP density improves WiFi performance; 2) over-dense deployment with unnecessarily high transmission power can worsen WiFi performance. 3) choice of AP vendors also has an impact on WiFi performance.},

  abstract = {An overview is given of the new IEEE 802.11n standard. This is the first wireless LAN standard based on MIMO-OFDM, a technique pioneered by Airgo Networks to give a significant performance increase in both range and rate relative to conventional wireless LAN. Performance results show that net user throughputs over 100 Mbps are achievable, which is about four times larger than the maximum achievable throughput using IEEE 802.11a/g. For the same throughput, MIMO-OFDM achieves a range that is about 3 times larger than non-MIMO systems. This significant improvement in range-rate performance makes MIMO-OFDM the ideal solution not only for wireless LAN, but also for home entertainment networks and 4G networks.},

  urldate = {2023-09-27},
  abstract = {As mobile Internet is now indispensable in our daily lives, WiFi's latency performance has become critical to mobile applications' quality of experience. Unfortunately, WiFi hop latency in the wild remains largely unknown. In this paper, we first propose an effective approach to break down the round trip network latency. Then we provide the first systematic study on WiFi hop latency in the wild based on the latency and WiFi factors collected from 47 APs on T university campus for two months. We observe that WiFi hop can be the weakest link in the round trip network latency: more than 50\% (10\%) of TCP packets suffer from WiFi hop latency larger than 20ms (100ms), and WiFi hop latency occupies more than 60\% in more than half of the round trip network latency. To help understand, troubleshoot, and optimize WiFi hop latency for WiFi APs in general, we train a decision tree model. Based on the model's output, we are able to reduce the median latency by 80\% from 50ms to 10ms in one real case, and reduce the maximum latency from 250ms to 50ms in another real case.},

  abstract = {Comparing market estimates for wireless personal communication and considering proposals for wideband multimedia services with the existing spectrum allocations for these types of systems show that spectrum resource management remains an important topic in the near and distant future. In this article the authors start by presenting a quite general formulation of the radio resource management problem where the three key allocation decisions are concerned with waveforms ("channels"), access ports (or base stations), and, finally, with transmitter power. Some approaches to these problems found in the literature are reviewed. In particular, the principles of random channel allocation schemes, as found in frequency-hopping or direct-sequence CDMA systems, are compared with deterministic dynamic channel allocation schemes. The article closes by giving an outlook of some of the key problems in resource management in future wireless multimedia systems.},
